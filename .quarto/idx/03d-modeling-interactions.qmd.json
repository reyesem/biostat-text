{"title":"Allowing Effect Modification (Interaction Terms)","markdown":{"headingText":"Allowing Effect Modification (Interaction Terms)","headingAttr":{"id":"sec-modeling-interactions","classes":[],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n{{< include _setupcode.qmd >}}\n\n@sec-glm-model-framework outlined three broad uses for creating a multivariable model.  @sec-modeling-related-predictors highlighted the benefit of _isolating_ an effect.  In this chapter, we discuss how to examine the _interplay_ between two predictors.  That is, we allow the effect of one predictor to be modified (or dependent upon) the value of another predictor.  This is done through \"interaction\" terms in the model\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\n\"Interactions\" are _not_ about the relationship between predictors.  Our goal is still to examine the relationship between the response and the predictor.  An interaction allows that relationship to depend upon another predictor.\n:::\n\nConsider a linear model which views the response as a function of two quantitative predictors and a categorical variable with only two groups; that is, \n\n$$(\\text{Response})_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Predictor 1})_i + \\beta_2 (\\text{Predictor 2})_i + \\beta_3 (\\text{Group B})_i + \\varepsilon_i$$ {#eq-interactions-base}\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n(\\text{Group B})_i = \\begin{cases}\n  1 & \\text{if i-th participant belongs to Group B} \\\\\n  0 & \\text{if i-th participant belongs to Group A.}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThis model says there is a single effect of the second predictor on the response; that is, the effect of Predictor 2 is the same for participants in Group A as it is for those in Group B.  What if we believe the effect is of Predictor 2 differs in the two groups?  A naive approach would be to consider two separate models:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  \\text{Model 1 (Group A Only)}:& \\quad (\\text{Response})_i = \n    \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 (\\text{Predictor 1})_i + \\alpha_2 (\\text{Predictor 2})_i + \\varepsilon_{1,i} \\\\\n  \\text{Model 2 (Group B Only)}:& \\quad (\\text{Response})_i =\n    \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 (\\text{Predictor 1})_i + \\gamma_2 (\\text{Predictor 2})_i + \\varepsilon_{2,i}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis creates some of the same problems we saw with creating multiple models in order to address categorical predictors (see @sec-modeling-categorical-predictors).  In particular,\n\n  1. We obtain two estimates of residual variance, but neither estimate is using the full data.\n  2. While we accomplished our goal of letting the effect of Predictor 2 differ in each group, we also allowed the effect of Predictor 1 to differ in each group.  If we believe the effect of Predictor 1 is the same across the two groups, allowing it to be estimated separately in each group is inefficient.\n  3. It makes it difficult to clearly conduct a hypothesis test to determine if there is evidence the effects are actually different; that is, it is harder to quantify the evidence that $\\alpha_2 \\neq \\gamma_2$.\n\nWe seek a modeling structure that allows the effect of the a predictor (Predictor 2 in the model above) to change for each value of the second predictor (the group structure in this case).  That is, we would like to capture the possibility illustrated in @fig-modeling-interactions-interactions.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-modeling-interactions-interactions\n#| fig-cap: Illustration of the interaction of a quantitative predictor and a qualitative predictor when predicting a quantitative response.\n#| fig-alt: In the first panel, two lines are overlaid on data and the lines have the same slope indicating no interaction.

Remember, our goal is to allow the effect of Predictor 2, captured by $\\beta_2$, to depend on the group to which the participant belongs.  Imagine replacing $\\beta_2$ with \n\n$$\\beta_2 = \\eta_0 + \\eta_1 (\\text{Group B})_i.$$\n\nNotice that this says the _effect_ $\\beta_2$ can depend on whether the participant is in Group B; if the participant is in Group A, then the indicator is 0 and $\\beta_2 = \\eta_0$.  If, on the other hand, the participant is in Group B, then the indicator is 1 and $\\beta_2 = \\eta_0 + \\eta_1$.  Substituting this in, we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  (\\text{Response})_i \n    &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Predictor 1})_i + \\left(\\eta_0 + \\eta_1 (\\text{Group B})_i\\right) (\\text{Predictor 2})_i \\\\\n    &\\qquad + \\beta_3 (\\text{Group B})_i + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n    &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Predictor 1})_i + \\eta_0 (\\text{Predictor 2})_i \\\\\n    &\\qquad + \\eta_1 (\\text{Predictor 2})_i (\\text{Group B})_i + \\beta_3 (\\text{Group B})_i + \\varepsilon_i.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nRecognizing that the choice of Greek letters $\\eta_0$ and $\\eta_1$ are arbitrary, we have the same model as in @eq-interactions-interactions.\n\n@eq-interactions-interactions adds another variable to the model that is the product of the second predictor and the group indicator.  Let's examine the structure that is provided here.  Suppose we are interested in examining the mean response for subjects in Group A; the value of the group indicator is 0 for these subjects, leading to\n\n$$E\\left[\\text{Response} \\mid \\text{Predictors, Group A}\\right] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1  (\\text{Predictor 1}) + \\beta_2 (\\text{Predictor 2}).$$\n\nFor subjects in Group B, the value of group indicator is 1, leading to the mean response\n\n$$E\\left[\\text{Response} \\mid \\text{Predictors, Group B}\\right] = \\left(\\beta_0 + \\beta_3\\right) + \\beta_1  (\\text{Predictor 1}) + \\left(\\beta_2 + \\beta_4\\right) (\\text{Predictor 2}).$$\n\nThis allows both the intercept and the slope associated with Predictor 2 to differ between the two groups.  That is, it allows not only a \"bump\" for being in Group B to the mean response, but it also allows the _effect_ of the second predictor to differ for the two groups.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Big Idea\nIn order to capture complex modeling structures, we embed those structures in a large model as opposed to fitting several smaller models in different subgroups of the population.\n:::\n\nWe prefer the strategy in @eq-interactions-interactions to performing a subgroup analysis.\n\n:::{#def-subgroup-analysis}\n## Subgroup Analysis\nRefers to repeating a specified analysis (e.g., regression model) within various levels of a categorical predictor.\n  \n  - This will appropriately estimate the effect modification.\n  - This results in a loss of information because _all parameters_ are forced to vary across the subgroups.\n:::\n\nThe new predictor added to our model in @eq-interactions-interactions (the product term) is known as an interaction term.\n\n:::{#def-interaction}\n## Interaction\nAn interaction term allows the effect of a predictor on the response to depend on the value of a second predictor (capturing an effect modification).\n\n  - The interaction term is created by adding the product of the two predictors under consideration to the model.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nWhile we have illustrated the use of interaction terms using a quantitative and categorical predictor, interactions can be used with any type of predictors.  For example, we could have considered the product of Predictors 1 and 2 in @eq-interactions-base if we had wanted to.\n:::\n\nWhile we have illustrated the use of interaction terms in a linear model, this is a general modeling technique that can be extended to other forms of regression models.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"center","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["mystyles.css"],"output-file":"03d-modeling-interactions.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
