# Unit III: General Modeling Techniques {-}

In the previous unit, we introduced the general linear model.  In this unit, we use the general linear model as the backdrop for introducing several modeling strategies that allow us to address common questions in scientific research.  While these strategies are introduced in the context of the linear model, they can be applied with all the models discussed in the text.
